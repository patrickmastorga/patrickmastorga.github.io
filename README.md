# My Website

This is my personal webpage where I display some information about myself, and links to some interesting applications I've made over the years.

## About the webpage

### 3D Backround

The 3D backround was made using three.js. I had losts of fun making lots of versions of the backround, and I often change the sprites/stars to different images or models to keep things fresh

### Webpage

The webpage is laid with bootstrap. I developed it using node.js, and packaged all of the javascript and css using webpack
