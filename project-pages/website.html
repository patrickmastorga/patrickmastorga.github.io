I purchased a domain name and hosted it on my Raspberry Pi from one of my parents internet ports I forwarded. When I moved out it went down.</p><p>At some point in the meantime, I was having fun with three.js to make funny 3D animated webpages, and I decided to turn one into my portfolio, hosted on GitHub. I used bootstrap to help with the formatting. For a couple years the website was painfully slow to load. Every year or so I would clean up/refactor most of the code. Most recently I picked up a modern workflow with Webpack and node.js, which made the website WAY faster. I'm quite proud of the source code now, and it feel professional to me.
