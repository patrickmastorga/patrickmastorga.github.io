Our project is a notepad app that can recognize any equation/expressions that you write and automatically solve it for you.</p><p>Since we were making a IOS application, it was a whole new experience learning a brand new language, Swift. Furthermore, we needed to learn how to incorporate REST APIs in the back end, which I had never done before. All this was to be done in less than three days. Overall, considering how much time had to be spent learning, I was satisfied with our final result. I had never learnt so much new stuff in such little time. At the end of the day, the app worked!</p></div><div class="btn-center"><a href="https://github.com/patrickmastorga/NotaSolverX" class="big button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source Code</a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 project-link"><img id="project-img" src="../images/hackgt-83a537359f62699741d5.webp" alt="hackgt"></div></div></div></body></html>
