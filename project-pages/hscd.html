We would meet after school in our engineering teachers classroom and discuss ideas. As an athlete in two varsity sports at the time, I was aware of the danger of concussions in sports. We tried to tackle this danger by building a wearable device to help high school athletes get the real-time attention they need when a concussion has occurred.</p><p>What began as a chaotic breadboard with a profusion of wires evolved into a sophisticated device consisting of a wearable prototype consisting of custom PCB integrated with a high-g accelerometer, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi antenna. The output of the device is synchronized with a IoT network and a full-stack web application, hosted on the sidelines from the coach's laptop. This enabled real-time data projection to the medical staff on the sidelines while managing a comprehensive database of g-force data to be used for future research. Thanks to the help of my head football coach we ordered a small batch of prototypes which we got to test in a few of my high school football practices.</p><p>Thanks to the help of our engineering teacher, we entered and won 1st place and the Health and Medical Technology Award at the GT InVenture Prize High School Division State Finals, followed by 3rd place at the Invention Convention Worldwide U.S Nationals. We went on to apply for a Patent which is currently under review.</p></div><div class="btn-center"><a href="../documents/hscd-presentation-138f5882ed443460717a.pdf" class="big button source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See More</a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 project-link"><img id="project-img" src="../images/hscd-2d-a99710f63f5ed78925f8.webp" alt="HSCD"></div></div></div></body></html>
