I was obsessed with programming fun web applications with JavaScript. One day I decided that I was going to program an algorithm that could beat me in a game. I started with simple games like Tic Tac Toe, and discovered the basics of decision making algorithm. I learned the minimax algorithm, which is the most basic approach for turn based zero-sum games.</p><p>As programming was new to me, it was enough of a challenge to create an evaluation function and move generation code. I put hours of effort into making a attractive graphical interface. But once I was done, the result was quite a formidable opponent! What made it even better was hosting the game on my website for my friends to play, and it actually became a popular lunchroom challenge among the kids in my grade.</p><p>NOTE: I am aware that Connect Four is a solved game. I am currently working on optimizing my code in C++ and utilizing Georgia Tech's computing resources to solve it myself.</p></div><div class="btn-center"><a href="https://github.com/patrickmastorga/connect-four" class="big button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source Code</a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 project-link"><img id="project-img" src="../images/connect-four-0bd57a83517ed81d8588.webp" alt="Connect Four"> <a href="https://patrickmastorga.github.io/connect-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div id="project-overlay" class="overlay"><p>Click to play</p></div></a></div></div></div></body></html>
