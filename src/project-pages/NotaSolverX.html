                    <p>This fall I led a team in my first Hackathon, HackGT X. Based on our experiences making mistakes while working out math problems, we decided that our project would be a notepad app that could recognize any equations/expressions that you write and can automatically solve it for you.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the challenge, the first major challenge was learning how to make an IOS application. I had to learn the language Swift, which although similar to JavaScript, posed some challenges. The second challenge was learning how to incorporate REST APIs in the back end, and processing the data from them to display on the front end. Overall, considering how much time had to be spent learning, I was satisfied with our final result. I look forward to competing in more Hackathons in the future.</p>
