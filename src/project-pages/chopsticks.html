                    <p>A childhood favorite, I knew I would be able to solve it. This project is noteworthy because I discovered a new way to implement the minimax algorithm on a game with a small enough number of states. I wasn't satisfied by how long the recursive approach took to run on my laptop. I proved that If I could save all of the possible game states in a lookup table, I could start by calculating all of the leaf nodes of the tree first, and then work backwards from there, one layer of depth at a time. This optimized the algorithm from running in exponential time to linear time (with respect to depth). I was able to prove that all possible winning tactics were found. Then, I implemented a simple heuristic which counted all possible wins stemming from a certain position, weighted by a exponential decay factor. This also utilized the same iterative approach that the minimax search was based upon.</p>
                    <p>The search algorithm was implemented in Python, and the web application merely looks up the best move from my lookup table.</p>
